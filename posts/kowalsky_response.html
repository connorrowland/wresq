				<h1>Response to Our Kowalksy Verdict</h1>
				<p>By William Ricigliano</p>
			</div>  
			<div class="defined-width-text">
				<p>
					We are very pleased to announce that the $5,088,000 verdict William Ricigliano, P.C. obtained more than 2 years ago against the County of Suffolk has finally made its way through the post trial and appeals process. The end result is complete justice for our client.  
				</p>
				
				<p>
					William Ricigliano, P.C. was hired as trial counsel in Kowalsky v. County of Suffolk to try a case involving a client who was run down by a Suffolk County Parks & Recreation vehicle.  As a result, our client suffered permanent and disabling injuries to his spine and knee.  After the verdict, the County filed post trial motions with the trial judge, who proceeded to reduce the verdict to $1,300,000. Following this unexplained reduction, the county appealed, requesting that the entire verdict be reversed and demanding a new trial.  
				</p>

					</p>
				</div>

				<p>
					We fought back, and filed a cross appeal to have the entire original verdict reinstated.  The Appellate Division, Second Department, in its written decision, reinstated the entire verdict with interest.  Following the Appellate Divisionâ€™s decision we were able to secure a 6.3 million dollar settlement for our client.  After waiting 7 years for justice, he was finally able to have the decision he deserved.
				</p>

				<p>
					Additionally, we are pleased to announce that William Ricigliano, P.C. has obtained the following results in the last quarter:
				</p>

				<p>
					<em>A 1.1 million dollar settlement</em> in Ocean County, New Jersey for a 56 year old woman injured in a head on collision.  As a result of the collision she suffered spinal injuries which required surgery and a traumatic brain injury.
				</p>

				<p> 
					<em>A 6.3 million dollar settlement</em> in Suffolk County for a 35 year old Verizon Field Technician run down by a Suffolk County Parks and Recreation vehicle and suffered injuries to his spine and knee which required surgery.
				</p>

				<p> 
					<em>A $1.5 million dollar settlement</em> in New York County for an electrician who fell from a ladder at a construction site and never returned to work.  The settlement was obtained despite the fact that the client died a year before the settlement was reached of unrelated causes.
