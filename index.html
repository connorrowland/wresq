			<h3>PHILOSOPHY OF THE FIRM</h3>
			<div class="thick-orange-divider-line"></div>
			<p>The primary goal of William Ricigliano, P.C. is to serve our clients.  The firm does not maintain a high volume practice, but rather, litigates a select number of cases, so that greater personal attention can be paid to our clients.  It is this attention to our client’s cases and their lives that separates William Ricigliano, P.C. from other personal injury firms.  Our attorneys are dedicated to maintaining contact with our clients to apprise them of the status of their case, but more importantly, we strive to listen to our clients.  We listen to the physical and emotional difficulties they are experiencing, we listen to their expectations regarding the outcome of their case and most importantly, we listen so that we can help in any way we can.</p>
