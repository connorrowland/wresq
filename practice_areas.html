			<h4>Catastrophic Personal Injury</h4>
			<p>Many of the firm’s clients suffer from catastrophic personal injuries-injuries caused by someone else’s negligent conduct which have totally transformed their life from one that is completely healthy and pain free to a life where chronic, constant pain and an inability to function on a day to day basis are the norm.  As a result of these devastating injuries, our clients lose their ability to work and support their families.<br>
			These injuries require a lifetime of future medical care, which includes costs related to future hospitalizations, physical and rehabilitative therapy, physician care, additional surgical procedures, pain management and medication. It is our job to fully protect our clients from all of these damages.<br>
			Whether it is our client who suffered horrific burns and smoke inhalation injuries from a fire, the client who suffered multiple fractures and head trauma after being run down by a negligent driver in a trucking accident, or the client who is unable to return to work and is still undergoing active medical treatment after a debilitating fall, the attorneys at William Ricigliano, P.C. are experienced in making sure our clients are fully compensated when these life altering injuries occur.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="defined-width-text" id="construction-accidents">
			<h4>Construction Accidents</h4>
			<p>Because of the dangers and risks involved in construction related projects, accidents occurring at a construction site are the most serious and debilitating. Workers using heavy machinery and operating from significant heights are in a very precarious position should an accident occur.<br>
			Construction claims involve provisions of the Labor Law which are in place for the protection of the construction worker and an investigation into whether rules were violated must be addressed with the utmost care and concern. These injuries prevent our clients from returning to their jobs in the industry and their initial concern is always the future of their family.<br>
			When these accidents occur, you need an experienced firm that not only has a full understanding of the applicable law, but is adept at making sure the parties responsible for the accident are held accountable.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="defined-width-text" id="motor-vehicle-accidents">
			<h4>Motor Vehicle Accidents</h4>
			<p>Motor vehicle accidents are life changing because in a blink of an eye, someone can be gravely injured due to the negligence of a driver, especially in the tri-state area, where there are countless vehicles on the roadways.<br>The firm handles all types of accidents caused by motor vehicles, including automobile collisions, trucking, motorcycle and ATV accidents, and collisions involving pedestrians.<br>
			From the beginning of your case, we will assist you in navigating through the difficult process of assuring that your medical bills are paid and our attorneys will make certain you receive proper medical treatment and are fully compensated for the serious injuries that have severely impacted your well being.

		<div class="defined-width-text" id="premises-liability">
			<h4>Premises Liability</h4>
			<p>As a former civil defense attorney and the author of Premises Liability Claims: A Guide to Defending Owners, Mr. Ricigliano developed a specialty in the area of premises liability claims. It is this experience and knowledge from the defense side that provides Mr. Ricigliano a decisive edge when litigating cases for those injured by a premises owner’s negligence.  Although premises owners are required under the law to maintain their property in a safe condition for those who enter upon the premises, many owners are negligent when living up to this obligation.<br>
			Our clients frequently sustain injury as a result of a building owner’s failure to maintain the interior stairs of their premises, secure their commercial spaces during a construction project, or make sure their building is free from structural defects and/or building code violations, which can result in serious injuries.<br>
			The attorneys at William Ricigliano, P.C. are well equipped to not only handle the legal aspects of these complex issues, we also work with a team of investigators, architects and other experts to assist the firm in determining whether building violations or other failures to maintain the property have caused a client’s accident.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="defined-width-text" id="medical-malpractice">
			<h4>Medical Malpractice</h4>
			<p>Nothing is more life changing than the client who suffers an injury due to medical negligence.  Whether it is a failure to diagnose a dreaded illness or disease, or the failed delivery of a newborn, the victims of medical negligence suffer immediate, life altering injuries, which often require a lifetime of medical care.<br>
			The opportunity for a good result in a medical malpractice case is dependent on attorneys with a detailed knowledge of the medicine involved, to not only prove the elements of the case, but to locate and retain the appropriate experts to establish the negligent conduct of the offending health care professional.<br>
			William Ricigliano, P.C. has the necessary knowledge of the applicable medicine and relationships with the appropriate experts to assure that our clients receive the best representation to secure an outcome that will protect their future health and well being from the devastating injuries suffered at the hands of a negligent medical provider.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="defined-width-text" id="products-liability">
			<h4>Products Liability</h4>
			<p>The proper handling of a products liability case begins immediately. Once we have agreed to represent a client, William Ricigliano, P.C. is skilled at quickly conducting a full investigation of the defective product to locate the potential negligent parties responsible for the injury including the manufacturer, distributor and retailer.<br>
			Product liability cases also require the proper use of experts to determine exactly what manufacturing or design defects were present at the time of injury and William Ricigliano, P.C. is well versed in working with these experts to prove the presence of such defects.<br>
			The manufacturers, distributors and sellers in product liability cases fight hard to prevent our clients from recovering their just compensation, and William Ricigliano, P.C. will fight as aggressively to expose the cause of the defect and assure our clients receive maximum compensation for injuries caused by the dangerous product.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="defined-width-text" id="inadequate-security">
			<h4>Inadequate Security</h4>
			<p>Some of the most traumatic and emotional injuries occur when a client is assaulted as a result of a lack of sufficient security on a premises. When these horrific injuries occur, it is imperative to conduct a full and thorough investigation immediately, before any vital evidence is lost or destroyed. Securing the appropriate documentation, together with a detailed knowledge of the state of the law in this area, is the key to obtaining a successful result.<br>
			Once the theory of the case is formulated, our attorneys work tirelessly to locate the parties responsible for the failed security and assure that the appropriate medical experts are able to discuss and describe for a jury how these incredibly traumatic events have such serious negative implications to the victims of these crimes.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="defined-width-text" id="wrongful-death">
			<h4>Wrongful Death</h4>
			<p>The most tragic scenario we face as personal injury attorneys is the untimely and unnecessary death of a client as a result of someone else’s negligence. A tragic death devastates a family and leaves them looking for answers and asking questions as to why a loved one has left them so unnecessarily. This is especially painful when the loved one is a young child or adolescent. The need for a skilled attorney after such an emotionally charged, life altering event is varied. For a young spouse and child, we protect their futures following the death of a father or mother, wife or husband. For the parents of a child taken away too early in life, their quest is for answers as to why their child is gone far too soon. For us, it’s about making sure we achieve the best results for our clients in the most terrible of circumstances. Whether it is protecting a child or a surviving spouse financially, helping to answer questions about how an accident occurred, fulfilling a family’s desire that something similar does not happen to another family, or making sure there are protections in place so that another child does not lose his or her life unnecessarily, our clients rely upon us for help. But it is also about more than just bringing a responsible party to justice for the loss of a loved one. It is about having the compassion and understanding to provide our clients comfort through the legal system during an emotionally devastating time. Our firm has the confidence and ability to achieve that result, but also the compassion to know what a difficult period it is for our clients and their families..</p>

		<div class="defined-width-text" id="dram-shop">
			<h4>Dram Shop/Liquor Liability</h4>
			<p>Dram shop liability occurs when a tavern, restaurant, or bar owner serves a patron alcohol while that person is in a visibly intoxicated condition and that intoxicated person then causes injury to another. This usually results in an assault, or a motor vehicle accident by an intoxicated driver.<br>
			These cases are difficult to prove and must be handled only by an attorney experienced in the means and methods of proving these types of cases. Hiring an attorney without the necessary experience to litigate a dram shop case can be fatal. If you or a loved one has been injured as a result of someone’s intoxicated conduct, William Ricigliano, P.C. will bring the parties responsible for causing the intoxication to justice.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="defined-width-text" id="tbi">
			<h4>Traumatic Brain Injury</h4>
			<p>The firm has developed a specialty in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), involving microscopic injury to the delicate cells that comprise the brain. Typically, these injuries are associated with the rapid acceleration/deceleration movement of the head, skull and brain, which occurs during a motor vehicle collision.  However, these injuries can be sustained in any accident where the head or skull is compromised. These injuries usually involve negative diagnostic testing, no loss of consciousness and negative neurological testing.<br>
			Our firm is adept at proving how someone can have negative testing, yet still suffer and demonstrate the dramatic effects of a brain injury. We rely upon our comprehensive knowledge of the anatomy and the  medicine associated with brain dysfunction to prove these debilitating, permanent injuries and we are experienced at proving not only the symptomology of TBI, but each and every element of our clients’ economic and non-economic damages related to brain injury.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="defined-width-text" id="crps">
			<h4>Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)</h4>
			<p>Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), also referred to as Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome (RSD) is a devastating syndrome that results in chronic, intractable pain. These conditions will typically result from trauma after an accident, or from surgery related to an accident. Clients who suffer from these conditions have hypersensitivity to pain and endure a lifelong struggle to manage their pain. The symptoms are almost exclusively diagnosed clinically, during a doctor’s examination and the firm is experienced in the manner and method of explaining this complicated injury, its symptoms and its long term effects to a jury.<br>
			These cases often prevent the client from returning to work or engaging in recreational activities, which makes these cases significant. The firm is affiliated with various organizations studying this condition and finding novel ways to treat it. The firm’s knowledge of these methods and the medicine behind the syndrome not only gives us an advantage at trial, but we are able to assure that our clients suffering from this disorder receive the best care available. This is especially so for those clients who require lifelong medical, pharmaceutical and home health care due to the serious symptoms the syndrome can cause.</p>
