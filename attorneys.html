				<h4>William Ricigliano</h4>
				<a class="atty-email" href="mailto:wricigliano@wresq.com">wricigliano@wresq.com</a>
				<p>
					In 2001, William Ricigliano founded William Ricigliano, P.C., with the single goal of helping victims of catastrophic personal injury on both sides of the Hudson River.  Since that time, he has obtained significant verdicts in both New York and New Jersey and has been named a Metro Area Super Lawyer the last three years.  Mr. Ricigliano views advocacy and trial practice as a craft and is dedicated to developing new and creative methods of telling his client&#39;s unique stories.  His victories in the courtroom have given him the opportunity to focus his attention in various areas of specialty.  A $3.775 million verdict in Suffolk County for an 8 year old boy who suffered a traumatic brain injury and required a lifetime of medical care sparked Mr. Ricigliano&#39;s devotion to victims of traumatic brain injury.  Similarly, a $2.6 million settlement after three weeks of trial in Brooklyn influenced his work with clients suffering from complex regional pain disorder, a chronic pain condition caused by trauma.  Mr. Ricigliano has also dedicated his practice to the representation of construction workers who sustain life altering injuries on the job.  These hard working men and women include carpenters, iron workers, roofers and industrial bridge painters, who typically are unable to return to their former occupations.   A significant portion of his practice is also related to handling spinal injuries, including a 5 million verdict in Suffolk County in 2015 for a Verizon Technician who was struck by a Suffolk County Parks vehicle, was forced to undergo spinal surgery and never returned to work.  Mr. Ricigliano&#39;s trial results have been included as verdict of the year on multiple occasions.
					<br><br>
					The firm&#39;s motto is &ldquo;Trust the Results&rdquo; because Mr. Ricigliano believes earning his client&#39;s trust and obtaining their desired results are the firm&#39;s top priority.  The firm is client centric and focuses on the person&#39;s individual needs and expectations during some of the most difficult times in their lives.  His philosophy is to work tirelessly, while also having the compassion to listen and learn how his clients cope with their injuries, so he can effectively be their voice in seeking justice.
					<br><br>
					In June of 2012, Mr. Ricigliano decided to expand the firm&#39;s presence and add a storefront office at 250 Brook Avenue in the Bronx to the firm&#39;s locations in Manhattan and Paterson, New Jersey.  Since the day the doors opened, the firm has been welcomed by the Bronx community.  In the last three years, through various events held at the Bronx office, including coat drives in the winter months and toy drives during the holiday season, Mr. Ricigliano has experienced the good fortune of meeting and representing hundreds of Bronx residents from the neighborhood.  This experience has been rewarding and he expects to be a fixture in the Bronx for many years to come.
					<br><br>
					Mr. Ricigliano graduated from Touro Law School in Huntington, New York in 1994 in the top 20% of his class and received a Bachelor of Arts Degree, Cum Laude, in Political Science from the University of Massachusetts in 1989.  He is a proud member of the Bronx Chamber of Commerce, North American Brain Injury Society, The American Association for Justice, New York State Trial Lawyers Association, and the New York Academy of Traumatic Brain Injury.  He is also a supporter of the International Association for the Study of Pain and Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome Association, City Meals on Wheels, St. Jude&#39;s Children&#39;s Hospital and Gallant Few, an organization that assists our veterans&#39; transition from active military service to civilian life.  Mr. Ricigliano has authored more than thirty legal articles and a legal book, Premises Liability Claims:  A Guide to Defending Owners.

				<h4>Frank Filopei</h4>
				<a class="atty-email" href="mailto:wricigliano@wresq.com">ffilopei@wresq.com</a>
				<p>
					Frank Filopei was born and raised in the Bronx, New York, and  grew up in a close family of Italian immigrants who arrived in the United States via Ellis Island. His upbringing stressed hard work and family values.  Mr. Filopei graduated from Rutgers University in 2004 with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Communications and obtained his law degree from Touro Law School in 2008. Mr. Filopei is proud to be the first member of his family to attend law school and obtain a Juris Doctorate Degree.
				<br><br>
					Mr. Filopei has spent his entire legal career with William Ricigliano, P.C. He began as an unpaid legal intern, worked his way up to the firm&#39;s managing associate and heads the firm&#39;s trial preparation team. One of Mr. Filopei&#39;s main interests is helping people who are legally disenfranchised. His grandfather was a New York City construction worker who suffered a premature death due to mesothelioma in the 1980&#39;s. Legal remedies were never explored or pursued on behalf of his family because they did not know their rights or that a cause of action existed. It is Mr. Filopei&#39;s goal to ensure that other people know their rights when corporations and insurance companies expose people to unnecessary risks and dangers solely to increase profits. 
				<br><br>
					Since 2008 Mr. Filopei's practice has focused on premises liability claims, multi-vehicle motor vehicle collisions, truck accidents, environmental exposure claims, dram shop litigation, construction accidents, negligent hiring and assault cases, and trial advocacy. He has obtained millions of dollars in recovery for his clients through settlement, arbitration, and trial.
				<br><br>
					Mr. Filopei is an active member of the American Association for Justice and the New York State Bar Association. He is a participant in the Wounded Warrior&#39;s Project
