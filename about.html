		<p class="defined-width-text centered-text">To assure that our clients obtain optimal results in every case, the firm has developed a specialty in trial practice.  Winning results at trial begin with successful trial preparation.  Our firm is tireless in the preparation of our cases for trial and we are unmatched when it comes to this aspect of our practice.  Our trial record speaks for itself and is not limited geographically.  The firm has achieved successful results in all the boroughs of New York City, Nassau and Suffolk Counties, as well as counties located in Northern and Central New Jersey.<br><br>Our experience and success in the courtroom is why a significant portion of the firm&#39;s practice is devoted to trying cases referred by other attorneys in New York and New Jersey.  These attorneys have repeatedly shown confidence in our ability, by allowing William Ricigliano, P.C. to represent their clients in some of their more challenging and difficult cases.<br><br>This  trust and loyalty has been rewarded, as we have consistently returned favorable verdicts for our referring attorneys and their clients time and time again, which has allowed the firm to foster long standing relationships with other law firms across the tri state area who continue to offer us the privilege of trying their client&#39;s cases.</p>
