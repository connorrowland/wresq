				Our greatest resource is our people.  Everyone at William Ricigliano, P.C. is devoted to the care and service of our clients and this dedication is what separates our firm from all others.  From the moment we first meet a new client until the time we resolve their case, our only goal is to achieve the best possible result during the litigation and beyond, even after the case is brought to a conclusion.  This requires us to not only learn each and every aspect of our client&#39;s case, but to know our clients as well.  Very often our clients experience unique and specialized challenges during the pendency of their case related to their financial condition while out of work, obtaining and paying for quality medical care and handling the trying emotional impact these cases have on them and their families.  Our entire team is vastly experienced helping our clients navigate through these trying times and collectively, we are adept at assisting our clients with whatever challenges they face.  It is the familiar voice and kind ear of our staff and attorneys that serves as hope for our clients that in the end, everything will be okay.

				In 2013 in an effort to be both physically and figuratively closer to the clients we represent we wanted to do something revolutionary.  We wondered, what if our office was on the ground floor of the community, where our neighbors could see us and know where we are every day.  How much more effective could we be helping people in that community?  What if the members of the community could just simply walk into our office whenever they needed our help?  What would it be like to have that kind of direct access to the people who need us the most?  This grand idea became a reality when we opened our storefront office on Brook Avenue in the Bronx.  The impact from that small gesture was immediate.  Our Bronx neighbors welcomed us with open arms and brought us into their lives and their hearts.  In a few short years we have made new friends, created formidable ties, served hundreds of clients in need and most importantly, given back to a community that has been so generous to our firm.  Working in the Bronx has been a remarkable experience and given all of us a new perspective on what it means to be  part of a community.
